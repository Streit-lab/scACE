# NF-cutandrun

This folder contains the run scripts to run the NF-core pipelines: 
- [NF-fetchngs](https://nf-co.re/fetchngs/1.12.0) to download previously published CUT&RUN data of the chick ectoderm from [Rothstein and Simoes-Costa 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31848212/)
- [NF-cutandrun](https://nf-co.re/cutandrun/3.2.2) to align this data to the genome and call peaks. 

More details on the data used in this analysis cane be found in this [README](https://github.com/evaham1/atac_neural_plate_border/tree/main/NF-cutandrun/data).
