CUT&RUN data details:

------------------------------------------------------------------

Data collection:
- from Rothstein and Simoes-Costa 2019 (https://genome.cshlp.org/content/30/1/35.long) -> GSE126880 for all data
- Neural plate border/neural crest dissections were performed on HH6/HH9 embryos (10 embryos/ 20 neural folds per experiment). Cells were dissociated in Accumax (Accutase, SCR006) cell dissociation solution for 20 minutes at RT under mild agitation. CUT&RUN experiments were carried out as described(Skene and Henikoff, 2017).
CUT&RUN libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, E7645) and sequenced with paired-end 37bp reads on an Illumina NextSeq500 instrument.
- Doesn't say anything about spike-in?

Methods:
"Neural plate border/neural crest dissections were performed on HH6/HH9 embryos (10 embryos/20 neural folds per experiment). Cells were dissociated in Accumax (Accutase SCR006) cell dissociation solution for 20 min at RT under mild agitation. CUT&RUN experiments were performed as previously described (Skene and Henikoff 2017). Protein Aâ€“MNase was kindly provided by Dr. Steve Henikoff. CUT&RUN for TFAP2A upon TFAP2B knockdown was performed in the same manner, only using embryos electroporated unilaterally with a DsiRNA for TFAP2B (IDT). Neural crest dissections were performed on HH9 electroporated embryos, and CUT&RUN was conducted on pooled tissues from the control versus the knockdown sides of the embryos."
"CUT&RUN libraries were prepared using the NEBNext ultra II DNA library prep kit (New England Biolabs E7645). Quality control of prepared libraries was conducted using an ABI 3730xl DNA analyzer for fragment analysis. Libraries were pooled to equimolar concentrations using the KAPA library quant kit ROX low qPCR mix (Roche 07960336001) and sequenced with paired-end 37-bp reads on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument."

Other potential data (for now not using this):

- From Bhattacharya, Azambuja and Simoes-Costa 2020 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7236757/) -> GSE142101 for all data
- Dorsal neural tubes were dissected from HH9+ (8ss) embryos, and a total of 20 neural folds were used/sample for CUT&RUN experiment. Cells were dissociated in Accumax (Accutase, SCR006) cell dissociation solution for 20 minutes at RT under mild agitation. CUT&RUN was perfromed as described by Skene and Henikoff, 2017.
CUT&RUN libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, E7645) using manufactures protocol. The libraries were sequenced with paired-end 37bp reads on an Illumina NextSeq500 instrument.

H3k27ac experiment:
- Stage: HH9+(8ss)
